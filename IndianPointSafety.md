Visitors will need a, government issued, photo ID with them the day of the visit.  Driver's license is preferred. Each visitor needs to make sure that the address on the form matches the one on the id. (Sometimes when people move they do not change the address on their license). Cameras and photo capable electronics such as cell phones or blackberries are not permitted in the plant. (If you want photos you can bring a camera but, I will need to take the pictures).
