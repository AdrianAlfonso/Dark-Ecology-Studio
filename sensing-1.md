#Analogue Sensing

Create or record an index of some element of the environment. You might directly observe a system in some way (drawing, a score, narration etc or you might do so through the constructions of some sort of simple apparartus). Come to class ready to show your results and documentation of your process. 
You should note, location, why you selected this place or thing, what was your method of documentation or intervention and why 
you chose this method.

Due: Tuesday morning.

Inspiration:

Check out the links in the resources page of the repository under environmental observation and the sensing lecture. 
Consider the following prompts:

-How would you use an ephemeral substance like chalk to mark a change in the environment over time?
-How can you use your body to measure an environment or dynamic process within it?
-Is your observation to be a momentary recording, a trace left over time, or a comparative observation.
