###How to write a literature review:

A literature review is an essay that outlines key academic sources and texts of background information for a particular area of study.   

As an essential starting point of a research project, a literature is written, usually from the third person (so not using I or me or abbreviations).
The aim of a literature review is demonstrate how the different readings relate and differ and to give a particular understanding of the research
subject. Relationships between texts may be found between such details as the varying use of jargon in relations to your area of study, whether the authors
that you're referencing reinforce or contradict each other, the expert credientials of the authors and their influence on the area of study. 
You should also mention any specific important ideas to your understanding of the subject or contribute to an existing debate established in another
text.

Please note that referencing a book with one author slightly varies from a book with multiple authores, e-books, journal papers, newspapers and 
conference papers. For this reason you should make yourself familar with a good MLA referencing guide such as [this one.](http://www.citethisforme.com/guides/mla)

###How to add creative resources to a review?

Artists and designers are not just informed by academic literature reviews in their work. Usually artefacts or media are significant resources 
that inform research being conducted for "creative works". For this reason you can also include references to creative resources such as artefacts
(art or design), environments, projects, systems and services. You must be able to critically and objectively argue how these resources significantly
contribute to your creative understanding of your research topic and work in the field.
