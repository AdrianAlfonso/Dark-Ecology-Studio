##Conceptual aims of this project.
In this assignment you will bring together everything you have learned about the potential for designers and artists to creatively intervene in human-technology-environment relations. You are to design an innovative interface, object, service or process that addresses one or more of the themes that have been discussed in lectures and tutorials. In particular this assignment offers you the opportunity to create “speculative objects”. The assignment requires you to create simple prototypes and develop ways of staging interactions between humans and environmental systems.

A note on eccentric interfaces and speculative work.
Speculation provokes thought and helps us to reflect on our current technology and environment relationship and imagine the different futures that we might build. Your interventions may have a practical purpose or a fictional purpose; they may be set in an imaginary future, or in our contemporary environment. Speculative work creatively embody ideas and understandings about human-environment relations. 

###Step One: Generate ideas
Begin by considering an issue or idea we have explored in class or that you know of in the local Purchase region?  Which of these do you want to address? What possibilities for innovative objects, services or processes does this issue raise?  Use sketching, brain-storming, body-storming and simple prototyping to develop your collaborative ideas - it is best to do this in groups.

###Step Two: Frame your brief
When you have identified the key insights, ideas and possibilities that you are interested in you should frame a brief for your design proposal.  Consider the following questions and write a paragraph on each: 
-	What ideas, themes or issues do you want to address in your design? 
-	What is the purpose or intention of your design?
-	Who is it targeted at? 
-	How will it work?
-	How does your research underpin this line of thought and what additional research might you need to do? 

###Step Three: Develop your proposal and prototype
Based on your self-generated brief you should develop and refine one design proposal and create a simple, but well resolved prototype that embodies your idea. 

Your prototype should be a 3 dimensional rough draft of your design. The prototype should function like a physical sketch - allowing you to “materialise” your idea, work though its various possibilities, identify its shortcomings and imagine new possibilities. 

You may build your project using the tools and platforms we overviewed in class last week, or you may make a demonstrative prototype in video or by a model. it should demonstrate one or more aspects of the design, allowing you to physically enact the way it will be used and interacted with. You should think of it as a well-developed prop that supports critical thinking and staged action. 

The production-values of the prototype need to be high enough for the class to understand and appreciate your design.

###Step Four: Document your prototype in use
Using video, photography, sketching, interviews and/or live performance you should document your prototype in use. Your documentation should demonstrate how your design proposal will innovatively extend human-environment relations.
