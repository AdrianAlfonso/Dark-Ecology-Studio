# Dark Ecology Studio

**Hours:** 2.30 - 6.10pm  
**Room:** Library 1004B  
**Professor:** Tega Brain  
**Office hours by appointment:**   
Monday 12-1pm.   
Wednesday: 2.30-3.30pm  

##Descripton
Humans have become an environmental force, a time of dark ecology. This class will explore what this means for the concept of environment through investigations of diverse systems such as power grids, water infrastructures and local ecoystems around campus. Students will be introduced to methods drawn from both scientific and artistic modes of inquiry including mapping, poetic and scientific sensing, visualization, and photography. How can we explicate the systems that sustain us? How might public interventions shift how we perceive and represent our deep connections to environmental systems? 

###1: Infrastructure taxonomies (week 1-2)
We begin by investigating some of the systems of infrastructure that support us locally on Purchase College campus. Through observation and research we will consider the components and interfaces of these larger networks.

**Project:** Infrastructure field guide.   

**Readings:**

* Jedediah Purdy, 2015, [Anthopocene Fever.](https://aeon.co/essays/should-we-be-suspicious-of-the-anthropocene-idea)
* Shannon Mattern, 2016, [Cloud and Field](https://placesjournal.org/article/cloud-and-field/).
* Timothy Morton, 2014, The Ecological Thought. 


###2: Investigating systems (week 3-7)
What of the larger regional systems designed to transport materials into and away from campus? Where are these things located and what are they like? For this part, we will be making two field trip and using ethnographic methods to record these sites.  

**Project:** Infrastructure sound works.

**Readings:**

* Whale and the reactor, Winner

###3: Eccentric interfaces (week 8-14)
Part 2 address our interconnectedness with environmental systems and other lifeforms. We will explore environmental data and its performance, understanding data-driven practices as being less about sensors, and more about structuring participation and experiences that foster localized environmental literacy and stewardship. 

**Project:** Eccentric interface
