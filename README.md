# Dark Ecology Syllabus

**Hours:** 2.30 - 6.10pm  
**Room:** Library 1004B  
**Professor:** Tega Brain, tega.brain@purchase.edu  
**Office hours by appointment:**   
Monday 12-1pm.   
Wednesday: 2.30-3.30pm  

##Description
Ours is a time of dark ecology, where humans have become an environmental force. What does this mean for what we understand the environment to be and our relationship to it? This course investigates diverse local systems such as power grids, water infrastructures and ecoystems around campus. Students will be introduced to methods drawn from both scientific and artistic modes of inquiry including recording, mapping, poetic and scientific sensing, visualization, and photography.  How can we explicate the systems that sustain us? How might public interventions shift how we perceive and represent our deep connections to environmental systems?

##Objectives
Students successfully completing all aspects of this subject will:

* Demonstrate an introductory understanding of ecocritical theorya and sociology of technology. 
* Develop a literacy of local environmental issues.
* Have furthered their ability to engage creatively and critically with the social, relational and spatial aspects of urban infrastructure systems.
* Have furthered their experience and skills in negotiating interdisciplinary creative production.


##Course Content

####1: Infrastructure taxonomies (week 1-3)
What are the systems of infrastructure that support us on campus and how so they appear to us? How do we expect these systems to work and how are they used? Through observation and research we will document the components and interfaces of these systems.

**Assignment:** Investigating infrastructure Part 1: Field guide. PDF due end of week 4.  


####2: Investigating systems (week 4-7)
What are the larger regional networks designed to transport materials into and away from Purchase? What makes up these systems and where are they located? We will be making several field trips and using ethnographic methods to record our experience of these sites.  

**Assignment:** Investigating infrastructure: Sound works. Works due for exhibition week 7.

####3. Environmental Sense and Sensibilites (week 8-14)

Part 3 returns us to campus to consider our relationship to the other lifeforms and environments onsite. We will explore methods of collecting environmental data and experiment with how it can be performed. We will understanding data-driven practices as being less about sensors, and more about structuring participation and experiences that foster localized environmental literacy and stewardship.  

**Assignment:** Eccentric interface. Proposals due week 11. Projects due week 14.

##Readings and homework:
Readings and homework are listed the week they are due and are compulsory. I advise printing out readings and doing them with a pen in hand. It helps to do these away from the Internet! Readings may be adjusted throughout term, so check back regularly for upcoming requirements. Also, note that I do not agree with the views expressed in these readings, in fact, some are included as I specifically disagree with the author's perspective. Always approach with a critical eye.

#####Reading response:
You are to make a short blog post (100-200 words) each week in response to the reading, citing a related example from your research. This could be a contemporary ecological/infrastructural issue, a personal experience, [a related creative work](https://github.com/tegacodes/Dark-Ecology-Studio/blob/master/PracticeReferences.md), a relevant [article/book chapter/jounal paper](https://github.com/tegacodes/Dark-Ecology-Studio/blob/master/Supplementary.md) etc. Provide a reference or link to the example in your post. In the week when you are to lead class discussions, come to class with at least 3 discussion questions prepared and include these in your blog post.
