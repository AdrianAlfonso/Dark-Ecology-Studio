# Dark Ecology Studio

##Descripton
We live at a time where humans have become an environmental force, a time of dark ecology. This class will explore what this means for the natural world through investigations of diverse systems such as power grids, water infrastructures and local ecoystems around campus. Students will be introduced to methods drawn from both scientific and artistic modes of inquiry including mapping, poetic and scientific sensing, visualization, and photography. How can we explicate the systems that sustain us? How might public interventions shift how we perceive and represent our deep connections to environmental systems?
