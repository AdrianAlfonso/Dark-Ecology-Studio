#Readings and homework:

Readings are available on the [class Moodle.](http://moodle.purchase.edu/moodle2/course/view.php?id=24943)

Readings and homework are listed the week they are due and are compulsory. I advise printing out readings and doing them with a pen in hand. It helps to do these away from the Internet! Readings may be adjusted throughout term, so check back regularly for upcoming requirements. Also, note that I do not agree with the views expressed in these readings, in fact, some are included as I specifically disagree with the author's perspective. Always approach with a critical eye.

#####Reading response:
You are to make a short blog post (100-200 words) each week in response to the reading, citing a related example from your research. This could be a contemporary ecological/infrastructural issue, a personal experience, [a related creative work](https://github.com/tegacodes/Dark-Ecology-Studio/blob/master/PracticeReferences.md), a relevant [article/book chapter/jounal paper](https://github.com/tegacodes/Dark-Ecology-Studio/blob/master/Supplementary.md) etc. Provide a reference or link to the example in your post. In the week when you are to lead class discussions, come to class with at least 3 discussion questions prepared and include these in your blog post.
