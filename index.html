			<h1>Description:</h1><br>
			Ours is a time of dark ecology, where humans have become an environmental force. 
			What does this means for how we understand the environment and our relationship to it? This course investigates diverse local systems 
			such as power grids, water infrastructures and ecoystems around campus. Students will be introduced to methods drawn from both scientific and artistic 
			modes of inquiry including recording, mapping, poetic and scientific sensing, visualization, and photography. How can these practices be used to explicate the systems that sustain us? How might public interventions shift how we perceive our deep connections to environmental systems?

						<h1>WEEKS 1 to 3: Infrastucture taxonomies</h1>
											What are the systems of infrastructure that support us on campus and how do they appear? Through observation and research your will explore and document the components, interfaces and affordances of these systems. <br><br>

							<span class="blue">Assignment 1: infrastructure field guide</span>.  <br> <br>
							Field guides or manuals are published forms used to simplify, catalogue and demystify complex systems. As <a href="https://placesjournal.org/article/cloud-and-field/">Shannon Mattern</a> observes, they are "necessarily reductive document(s)" that "atomize a specimen into recognizable parts". Your specimens are either water/wastewater, energy, information or solid waste/garbage systems on campus and one of the challenges of this task is what to include and what to omit. <br> <br>
							In small groups you are to produce a field guide for your chosen system.  Research and review <a href="https://github.com/tegacodes/Dark-Ecology-Studio/blob/master/PracticeReferences.md">field guides</a> made by other artists and designers and decide how you will catalogue your chosen system, how you will document it and how you will ultimately publish it. <br> <br>

							You are to write a short text(s) to be included in your guide in response to your research and the <a href="https://github.com/tegacodes/Dark-Ecology-Studio/blob/master/Supplementary.md"> supplementary resources listed here for your system.</a>

						<br><br>



					

						<h1>Weeks 3 to 7: Investigating Systems</h1> 


						What are the larger regional networks that Purchase infrastructures are connected with? What makes up these systems and where are they located? We will be making field trips to a waste water treatment plant, a materials recycling plant and a nuclear power station and using ethnographic methods to record our experience of these sites.

							<span class="blue">Assignment 2: Infrastructure sound works</span>. <br> <br>
							Many of the sites we will visit do not allow photography but permit sound recording. Given this ocular sensitivity, you are to use field recording techniques to document the sound of your chosen system of infrastructure during one of the class field trips or otherwise. From your recordings produce a sound work that recreates your experience of one or more sites relevant to your chosen system.

Explore and research other works of <a href="https://github.com/tegacodes/Dark-Ecology-Studio/blob/master/PracticeReferences.md">sound ethnography</a> on the references page.<br><br><br>


						<h1>Weeks 7 to 14: Environmental sense and sensibilies</h1>


						Part 3 returns us to campus to consider our coexistence with other lifeforms and environments onsite. We will explore methods of collecting environmental data and experiment with how it can be performed. We will understanding data-driven practices as being less about sensors, and more about structuring participation and experiences that foster localized environmental literacy and stewardship.
